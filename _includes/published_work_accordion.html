                  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Todayâ€™s increase in computational resource demand requires robust job scheduling performance in shared HPC systems, which have varying workload characteristics. We applied a previous theoretical work on a walltime corrective scheduling to a full-scale production-level resource-constrained HPC cluster. We analyzed its performance by comparing the simulated and actual production implementation with various workload scenarios. The results showed a significant difference between theory and reality and thus rendered us substantial insights to adjust the scheduling policies accordingly for effective resource management that similar resource-constrained HPC clusters could benefit from.

                  <strong>Abstract:</strong> A resource-constrained HPC system such as the Computing and Archiving Research Environment (COARE) facility provides a collaborative platform for researchers to run computationally intensive experiments to address societal issues. However, users encounter job processing delays that result in low research productivity. Known causes come from the limited system capacity and the relatively long and rarely modified default walltime. In this study, we selected and characterized real HPC workloads. Then, we reviewed and applied the recommended runtime or walltime-based predictive-corrective scheduling techniques to reduce long job queues and scheduling slowdown. Using simulations to determine walltime scheduling performances on environments with limited capacity, we proved that our proposed walltime correction, especially its simple version, is enough to increase scheduling productivity. Our experiments significantly reduced the average bounded scheduling slowdown in COARE by 98.95 with a predictive-corrective approach, and 99.90 with a correction-only algorithm. Systems with large job diversity as well as those comprising of mostly short jobs significantly lowered delays and slowdown, notably with walltime correction. These simulation results strengthen our recommendation to resource-constrained system administrators to start utilizing walltime correction even without prediction to eventually increase HPC productivity.

                  <strong>Abstract:</strong> The exposure of the DOST-ASTI automated weather stations (AWS) to extreme weather events makes conventional condition-based maintenance methods insufficient in terms of preventive maintenance for proactive or corrective actions. The integration of machine learning to early failure detection, meanwhile, has become part of continuous developments on predictive maintenance (PdM). This study shows that by employing machine learning algorithms, failure of an AWS in one to eight weeks of time based on its data-forwarding behavior is predictable. There is some relation between the 7-day mean and variance of an AWS data-forwarding frequency and the condition of an AWS weeks in advance. Results also show that applying synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) in preprocessing is an effective method to balancing the dataset.
