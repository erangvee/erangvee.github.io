        Hi, I'm Aira. I am a computational infrastructure engineer at the <a href="https://philsa.gov.ph/" style="color: #fff;">Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA)</a>.   
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        I support mission-critical systems and software that enable space operations, ensuring reliability, performance, and secure data flow across the Agency's infrastructure. My work sits at the intersection of operations, systems engineering, and governance, where stability and precision matter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        My background includes research on high-performance computing (HPC), particularly in cluster optimization and malleable job scheduling systems. Today, I am leading efforts to build PhilSA's HPC infrastructure from the ground up — from architectural planning and deployment to performance validation and operational hardening.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        I am also actively involved in initiatives supporting the establishment of the Copernicus National Mirror Site for the <a href="https://copphil.philsa.gov.ph" style="color: #fff;">National Copernicus Capacity Support Action Programme for the Philippines (CopPhil)</a>, contributing to national capability development in Earth observation data access and utilization.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">O
        Beyond infrastructure, I work across DevOps practices, cybersecurity, and IT governance. Outside of tech, I occasionally explore digital painting as a creative outlet.
