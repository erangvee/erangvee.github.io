description: | 
    Our team designed the implementation of the new HPC cluster of the Computing and Archiving Research Environment (COARE) called the _[saliksik](https://asti.dost.gov.ph/coare/wiki/Main/about-coare/service-catalogue/hpc)_. We implemented the findings we had from our published research:
    
    - [Simulation vs Actual Walltime Correction in a Real Production Resource-Constrained HPC](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3437359.3465583) (2021)
    - [Correcting job walltime in a resource-constrained environment](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/978-3-030-48842-0_8) (2020)
