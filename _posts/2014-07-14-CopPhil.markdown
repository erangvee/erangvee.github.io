description: I am heavily involved in the activities leading towards the deployment of the Copernicus National Mirror Site (the CopPhil Infrastructure), which is dedicated to the efficient distribution of large datasets in a controlled cloud environment. The Mirror Site's goal is to provide free, open, and immediately accessible information services through a Copernicus Data Center.
